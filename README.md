```

2. Copy its directory and add it to PATH:

```bash
cp -r tools/claude-usage .claude/tools/claude-usage

# Add to PATH (e.g. in ~/.zshrc)
alias claude-usage="/path/to/.claude/tools/claude-usage/tools/claude-usage.ts"
```

3. See the tool's README for full setup instructions

## Skill Format

Every skill follows the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

```
skills/<name>/
  SKILL.md          # Skill definition (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
  README.md         # User-facing documentation
  tools/            # Optional CLI tools (bash, python, etc.)
```

## Tool Format

Tools are standalone CLI executables — no SKILL.md required:

```
tools/<name>/
  README.md         # User-facing documentation (install, PATH setup, usage)
  tools/            # Executable(s) (bash, python, TypeScript, etc.)
```

## Development Setup

If you're contributing, enable the pre-commit security hooks:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This runs automatic checks for secrets, hardcoded paths, and internal references before every commit.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the skill/tool format and PR checklist.

Maintaining a private project with skills or tools to share? [publish-skill](skills/publish-skill/) automates stripping internal references, security scanning, and publishing — the same tool used to maintain this repo.
